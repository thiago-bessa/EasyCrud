# Introduction 

The object of EasyCrud is to make it easier to develop simple websites that requires CRUD operations (similar to CMS).

Instead of having to develop each single page for CRUD operations for each single Table, you just have to add some "Attributes/Annotations" to your EF6 DbSets and Classe/Properties, and it will generate a menu, list, and edit pages automatically (By using Reflection).


ATTENTION: This is a personal project still in early stage of development
